#Rolling on Random
**Author:** Zane Draper

**Platform:** Processing

**Language:** Processing

**Project Description:**

* This project displays a dragon shaped kite, show the strings and sectioned body. This dragon moves using a Perlin Noise random generator to decide the height of the body in a smooth fashion. Other kites also scroll by, both behind and in front of the Dragon. These kits also move in a smooth motion decided by the Perlin Noise random generator. Another aspect of the Dragon is that is breathes fire in random intervoles, releasing jets of flame that is comprised of circles of varying size, color and fade rate. The circles are also projected at varying angles to create a little variety. 

* In the background, there are two moons which are slowly moving across the sky at their own rates. There are also stars randomly dispersed across the sky, using Guassian random generators to decide on location and the opacity of the stars. Also, there is a cover that fades in and out over the stars and moons to create a dark effect to show the rain better. 

* Finally, there is rain in the scene. This rain is on top of everything else, and comes and goes in intervoles, fading in and out as it goes. The rain is randomly generated in varying amount using Perlin Noise to create a more natural looking rain. The speed, opacity and number of the rain is also randomly generated.

**Code:**

* Perlin Noise:
    * Timing for gaps between events
    * Kite movements
* Gaussian:
    * Kite spawn timing
    * Kite color
    * Fade of stars
* Other random elements:
    * Rain population
    * kite depth
    * Fire color, angle and fade out rate
    * Kite scales and locations
    * many others...

**Room for Improvement:**

* I would love to get a better day/night cycle working and to improve on the fire. The secondary kites 
don't feel as 'alive' as I would like.
